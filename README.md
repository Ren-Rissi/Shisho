# Shisho
My first repository, for tests and study!

Following the GitHub Hello World Guide, but wanted to call it Shisho because Shisho is a character of mine, and also my avatar here (a friend drew him for me!), he was originally created for a roleplay with friends, but I love him and am using everywhere.

I'm a Computational Physics student and discovered that I love Data Science few time ago while taking Modelling classes, which led me to take more relate classes like Patter Recognition and Analysis and Image Processiojn and Vision, now I want to learn much more about it! My particular interrests are to learn enough to use as a tool to solve finance and economy problems, so I also need to learn about those topics.
